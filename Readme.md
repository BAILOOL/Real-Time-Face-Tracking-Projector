Software is available free of charge and it is a students' project for Undergraduate Research Participation(URP) Competition at KAIST, South Korea.

This software solves the problem of getting blinded or distracted from giving a presentation by the light that is projected on a presenter's eyes from a projector. This software blacks out the region where presenter's face is located. When face region is blacked out, it has been proven that presenters do not feel any discomfort and do not get distracted. Software continuously finds face's location, thus, presenter's face is always blacked out.
